## Current Projects

### Causal Inference for Natural Language Processing

- Developing a casually sufficient dimension reduction methodology for text data.

## Past Projects

### Experimental Design

*Overview* : Developed a design comparable effect size for the single-case alternating treatment design.

- Developed estimators of the effect size parameters and derived approximate small sample properties of the estimators analytically using quadratic forms. 
- Evaluated properties of the developed estimators using multilevel simulation models.
- Created visualizations using trellis plots to communicate the results to a non-technical audience.


### Modeling Brain Imagaing Data

*Overview* : Developed modeling and analysis for a package performing statistical analysis on a software that largely automated processing of MRI of the human brain.

- Developed mixed modeling capabilities for tensor based morphometry (TBM), diffusion parameter maps, and region of interest (ROIs) analyses. 
- Optimized mixed modeling processes to reduce computational intensity.
- Implemented a variety of other statistical analyses and tests for TBM, diffusion parameter maps, and ROIs as well. 
- Created outputs in R Shiny to facilitate ease of output understanding for users.

### Modeling Atmospheric Data Models

*Overview* : Determined which existing models for prediction of hazardous release movement are best suited for prediction, and uncovered patterns among outlying model types.

- Modeled the outliers using k-means to determine which categories of models resulted in most and least effective prediction. 
- Uncovered outliers using Local Outlier Factor methodology.
- Determined existing patterns among the outlying model types.
