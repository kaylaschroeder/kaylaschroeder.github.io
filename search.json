This new methodology will provide a way to make interpretable causal conclusions about topics and their predicted outcomes through a dimension reduction process. No such methodology exists currently.\nIn additon, this methodology will also be useful in the scenario where text is the treatment, which is a complex and multifaceted scenario that is not handled well by existing methodologies."
